*This mod is still incomplete. Dynamic yoyo ranges are a work in progress. Multiplayer compatibilty is still being tested. Balancing is also being tested and tweaked.*

Calamity Yoyo Bag Buffed is a mod that strengthens the effects of the yoyo bag for the Calamity Mod so that yoyo users are not forced to rely on other weapon types to progress in certain more-difficult sections of the game. This mod creates four new yoyo bags meant to be crafted post-Moonlord. Use the Guide NPC to assist with crafting recipes.
